Setup a virtual environment using venv on your local machine{OPTIONAL}. 
Git clone the repository to the virutal environment.

Run the command <pre>sh secret.sh</pre> and when prompted, hit enter.
It spits out the url with token to be used for testing later so do save it.

Open the web/docker-compose.yml

Add the token generated above after the url to YOURAPP_ENV.
Please see the example below:
<pre>YOURAPP_ENV: "xxxxxx"</pre>

Then run the command <pre>docker-compose up --build -d</pre>

Open a browser. Preferably not chrome as it doesn't allow self-signed-certificates. 
Browse to the full http url above and use the credentials below to login:
<pre>
username: username
password: password
</pre>
Then open a private browser window to test https with the url. Use the same credentials above.

<pre>
usage

localhost/{TOKEN}
</pre>

Launching this should generate two containers the web_proxy is tied to the host at port 80 and 443, while the web_app is exposed at 80 and can be a randon port from the host.

The Dockerfile at the proxy directory accepts an ARG and an ENV which is passed to the defaut.conf of the proxy server and subs out the "SECRET" for the token generated.

This part in the Dockerfile is used to generate the password and username

<pre>
/etc/nginx/.htpasswd username password
</pre>

The domain used is server_name localhost.
